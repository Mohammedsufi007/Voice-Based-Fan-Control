Voice-Based-Fan-Control
Voice-Controlled Fan is an Arduino-based smart home project that allows users to control a fan using voice commands through speech recognition, demonstrating basic IoT automation and hands-free appliance control.

🔊 Voice-Controlled Fan using Arduino

A *Voice-Controlled Fan* project developed using *Arduino, enabling users to control a fan through voice commands. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of **smart home automation* using speech recognition and microcontroller integration.

📌 Project Description

This project allows a user to turn a fan *ON or OFF using voice commands* given through a smartphone. The voice input is processed using a speech recognition system and transmitted to the Arduino via a communication module (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi). Based on the received command, Arduino controls the fan using a relay module.

🎯 Objectives

- To implement hands-free control of household appliances  
- To demonstrate Arduino-based IoT automation  
- To understand speech recognition and microcontroller interfacing  
- To build a low-cost smart home prototype  

⚙️ Working Principle

1. The user gives a voice command through a mobile phone.
2. The voice command is converted into text using speech recognition.
3. The command is sent to the Arduino via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
4. Arduino processes the command logic.
5. A relay module switches the fan ON or OFF accordingly.
