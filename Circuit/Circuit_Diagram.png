🔌 Circuit Diagram Description

 The circuit consists of an ESP32 development board, a single-channel relay module, a DC fan, and a 9V power supply.

🔹 ESP32 to Relay Connections
-ESP32 GPIO 23 → Relay IN
-ESP32 GND → Relay GND
-ESP32 VIN / 5V → Relay VCC

🔹 Relay to Fan Connections
-Relay COM → Positive terminal of 9V battery
-Relay NO (Normally Open) → Positive terminal of the DC fan
-Fan negative terminal → Negative terminal of 9V battery

🔹 Power Supply
-ESP32 is powered using a USB cable from the laptop.
-The fan is powered using a 9V battery, isolated from the ESP32 through the relay.

⚙️ Working of the Circuit

-When a voice command is given through the mobile phone, the ESP32 receives the command via Bluetooth.
-The ESP32 activates the relay by setting GPIO 23 LOW.
-The relay completes the circuit, allowing power to flow to the fan.
-When the OFF command is given, the relay opens the circuit and the fan stops.
